<h1>freemco NES Corelib</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/freem/nes_corelib">freemco NES Corelib</a> is a set of routines for coding stuff on the NES. However,
they haven't been tested on real hardware, and it's nowhere near complete.</p>
<p>Basically, if you're not me, good luck.<br/>
-<em>freem</em></p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>The freemco NES Corelib was originally developed alongside the MMC1 version of
Family Picross, as well as Bumpin' Cars.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Coded by a complete 6502 asm noob!</li>
<li>Routines I actually wrote!</li>
<li>Routines borrowed from the internet!</li>
<li>Some routines I bought on the black market!*</li>
</ul>

<small><sup>*</sup> Black market routines may not be included in the public version
of the Corelib.</small><br/><br/>

<h2>To Do</h2>
<p>There's a lot of things to do, but here are some main ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>The private version of the code is further along, but needs to be cleaned up,
updated, and finished before committing, much less release.</li>
<li>No APU/Sound/Music support yet. (Yeah, that's pretty big.)</li>
<li>&quot;VRAM Buffer&quot; routines not yet complete.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Documentation To-Do</h2>
<p>(e.g. this page and ones like it)</p>
<ul>
<li>iNES header explanation</li>
<li>Library routine documentation</li>
<li>Examples</li>
</ul>
