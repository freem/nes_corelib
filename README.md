freemco NES Corelib
===================
The freemco NES Corelib is a set of routines for coding stuff on the NES.

However, this hasn't been tested on real hardware, and it's nowhere near complete.

If you're not me, good luck.

## History
The freemco NES Corelib was originally developed alongside the MMC1 version of
Family Picross, as well as Bumpin' Cars.

## Features
- Coded by a complete 6502 asm noob!
- Routines I actually wrote!
- Routines borrowed from the internet!

## To Do
There's a lot of things to do, but here are some main ones:
- Private version of the code is further along but needs to be cleaned up, updated, and finished before release.
- No APU/Sound support yet
- "VRAM Buffer" routines not yet complete
- Missing a lot of functionality.

## "If it's this incomplete, why are you opening the source?"
I needed an external kick in the ass to make this library happen, and two projects I'm working on for the [2014 NESDev compo](http://nesdevcompo.nintendoage.com/contest14/).
As far as I know, there's no real "library" for coding NES games in ASM... Every project has their own version of the same code (and rightfully so; some games need different routines than others).
