<h1>freemco NES Corelib</h1>
<p>This is a reference to the routines available in the freemco NES Corelib, as well
as a reference to any tools you may want to use in developing NES games.</p>
<p>Note: This (incomplete) documentation is being phased out in favor of a NaturalDocs-based
setup.</p>

<h2>Function/Routine Reference</h2>
The freemco NES Corelib is split into multiple parts based on the functionality
they expose.

<ul>
<li><a href="./overview.html">Quick Overview</a> (includes <code>nes.inc</code> and <code>ram.inc</code>)</li>
<li><a href="./ppu.html">PPU</a> (Graphics)</li>
<li><a href="./apu.html">APU</a> (Sound)</li>
<li><a href="./io.html">I/O</a> (Controllers)</li>
<li><a href="./math.html">Math</a></li>
<li><a href="./util.html">Utilities</a></li>
<li>Mapper-Specific</li>
<br/>
<li>Appendix A: Palettes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>When developing NES games, it's useful to have tools around. I mean yeah, you
can write an entire NES game with a hex editor if you wanted to, but it's really
tedious and requires you to have memorized damn near everything.</p>

<h3>Compilers</h3>
<p>There are quite a few 6502-targeting compilers out there, but I've only tested
and developed this code on ASM6 (and ASM6f).</p>

<h4>ASM6</h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://home.comcast.net/~olimar/NES/">ASM6</a></strong> is a 6502 compiler and linker by Loopy. The source code is a single C
file containing portable code. If you're not afraid of the command line/terminal,
ASM6 is available for all platforms. (Though you may need to compile it yourself.)</p>

<h5>ASM6f</h5>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/freem/asm6f">ASM6f</a></strong> is a fork of
ASM6 by freem (hey, that's me!). While it's not required for using the Corelib, its
ability to export <a href="http://www.fceux.com/web/home.html">FCEUX</a>-compatible
.nl files may be helpful for debugging.</p>

<h3>Graphics</h3>

<h4>YY-CHR</h4>
<p>YY-CHR is a pretty good program for editing the graphics of old video games
(assuming the graphics aren't compressed). The <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/yy_6502/yychr/index.html">.NET version</a>
works better in Windows 7, while the <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/yy_6502/yychr/0yychr.html">original C++ version</a>
works better in Windows XP and Wine. The two versions are mostly similar, though
the .NET version lacks the Selection tool and the half-tone pattern tools.</p>

<h3>Nametables</h3>
(todo: tepples' screen tools)

<h4>NES Screen Tool</h4>
<p>Shiru's <a href="http://shiru.untergrund.net/software.shtml">NES Screen Tool</a>
allows you to interactively place tiles, change the palettes and attributes, and
also edit the tiles if you need to. Works in Wine, if you're not on Windows.
(Unrelated to nametables, it also has a Metasprite builder, which you might find useful.)</p>

<h3>Sounds and Music</h3>
<p>By no means is this an exhaustive list. This is blatantly missing various MML-based
solutions. Do people still use NerdTracker 2?</p>

<h4>Famitracker</h4>
<p><a href="http://famitracker.com/">Famitracker</a> is a very popular NES tracker that supports various sound extensions
and has a playback engine available. This engine is good for your games... if all
you need to do is play music.</p>

<h4>Muse</h4>
<p>thefox has made a playback library called <a href="http://kkfos.aspekt.fi/projects/nes/libraries/muse/">MUSE</a>,
which is more suited to NES games. Music data is exported from <a href="http://kkfos.aspekt.fi/projects/nes/tools/musetracker/">Musetracker</a>
(formerly known as "Pornotracker", if you ever see references to that).</p>

<h4>Famitone2</h4>
<p>Shiru recently released an update to <a href="http://shiru.untergrund.net/code.shtml">Famitone</a>,
an engine capable of handling both sounds and music at the same time.</p>

<h4>MetalSlime's Engine</h4>
<p>MetalSlime's sound engine is presented as a tutorial in ten parts; the first part
is available <a href="http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&threadid=22484">here</a>.
The sound engine I'm working on for the corelib is based off of this tutorial.</p>

<h4>GradualGames's Engine</h4>
<p>Derek Andrews of Gradual Games has <a href="http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=11655">a sound engine</a>
supporting four channels of music and two channels of sound effects.</p>

<h4>bloopageddon</h4>
<p><a href="http://average.truechiptilldeath.com/nesdev/bloopageddon.zip">bloopageddon</a>
by ReaperSMS is probably not fit for public consumption yet, based on the todo file.
If you are brave enough, you might be able to do something with it.</p>
