License? What license? I don't need no steenking license!

But if you insist I need a license, here you go:

						The I DON'T GIVE A FUCK License
Any question you ask could possibly ask me regarding the usage of this library
with regards to legalities ("can I use this"), copyrights ("is there one"),
modifications, forks, commercial usage, and so on, has this answer:

"I DON'T GIVE A FUCK."

:D

(Alternatively worded: You are permitted to do whatever you wish with this code.)
