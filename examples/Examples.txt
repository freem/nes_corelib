freemco NES Corelib Examples
============================
A number of example projects for the freemco NES Corelib are included.
The projects use relative paths to the corelib source files, which means you'll
want to edit those paths if you're working on them in a different place. Sorry!

Aside from the corelib files, each project is meant to be self-contained.

The examples are meant to be short, while trying to show enough possibilities of
what can be done.

[00_skeleton]
A skeleton setup, used for the other examples.

[01_helloBG]
"Hello World" on the background layer.

[02_helloSpr]
"Hello World" on the sprite layer.

[03_paletteBasics]
NES palette basics.

[04_inputBasics]
Basic introduction to input handling (regular controllers only).

Other examples are yet to be thought of...
* Nametable stuff (e.g. using unrle, updating the BG)
* Scrolling
* Collision (sprite->sprite, sprite->background)
* Metasprites
* Sound (2A03 only; others are introduced with mappers)
* CHR-RAM
* PRG-RAM
* Basic Mappers (e.g. anything less complex than MMC1)
* Intermediate Mappers (e.g. anything less complex than MMC5)
* Advanced Mappers (e.g. MMC5, etc.)
