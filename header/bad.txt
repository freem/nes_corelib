[Mapper 100]
Different emulators treat mapper 100 differently. Most don't support it.

Nestopia v1.4.0 uses it as a magic number to mean "anything whose dumps only
exist as UNIF (and therefore has no iNES mapper number assigned)".

Nintendulator uses it as a general-purpose debugging mapper, allowing PRG and
CHR banks to be selected via a dialog.
